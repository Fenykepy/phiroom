===       bugs         ===
==========================
    - drop picture from folder less to another : picture is not removed
#    - drag image not seen when grid list is scroll down (because invisible
#    - drag and drop directives don't parse data attribute when it contains a dot
#        exemple : ph-drop-data="mypicture" -> {pk: 1, â€¦} object is get
#                  ph-drop-data="pictures.mypicture" -> undefined object is not get
